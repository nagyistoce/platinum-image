vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor README
----------------------------------

vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor is a VTK class (actually FLTK too, but it helps
to think of it as VTK) that enables VTK to render to and interact with your
FLTK application.  It is based on code by David Pont (the code was then
called FlvtkInteractorWindow) which in its turn was partly based on the
wxVTK code by David D. Marshall and Brian Todd.  I reworked the code
extensively to be simpler, more robust and bug-free(tm).  It should always
be available from http://cpbotha.net/vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor.html.

The main idea behind this class is to be as simple and robust as possible.
It fulfils one purpose and that's to enable you to write applications with
FLTK and VTK.  It is possible to have multiple VTK renderings (all active)
in your FLTK application, each with its own independent working VTK
interactorstyle.  You can also add custom interactorstyles, just like with
any standard VTK interactor.  Picking also works fine, thank you.

ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: NEVER, I REPEAT NEVER, "delete" an instance of this
class.  Being a VTK object, it makes use of the same reference counting,
i.e. use ->Delete() !!!

I have included a modified example from the VTK distribution (Cone3.cxx)
that illustrates the use of this class.  Please study this example thoroughly
before shooting off that idiotic email. :)  You can build it by making use
of CMake and the included CMakeLists.txt as you normally would.  The older
example GNU Makefiles for VTK3 and VTK4 are also included, but it is not
recommended that you use these.

Required
--------

* >= fltk 1.0.10 (theoretically 1.0.9 should work, but I've not tested this)
* VTK 3.2.0 CVS tree checkout or VTK 4.0 and later (VTK 5.0 also works)
  

Tested configurations
---------------------

* This class has been part of the ITK InsightApplications distribution for
  quite a while now, so it has had extensive testing on Windows, Linux,
  MacOS-X (I believe), and other platforms where ITK is used.

Notes
-----

Shrinivas Kulkarni explains how to get vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor working
with FLTK 2.0:
I was able to use your vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor with FLTK2.0. Only 
changes I need to made were:

#include <FLTK/win32.H>
TO
#include <FLTK/x.H>

and
RenderWindow->SetWindowId( (void *)fl_xid( this ) );
TO
RenderWindow->SetWindowId( (void *)fltk::CreatedWindow::find(this)->xid);
