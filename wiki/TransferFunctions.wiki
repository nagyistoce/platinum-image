#summary plans for transfer function implementation



=Integration=
The transfer objects's main function operates on an [image_general] iterator. It may also need access to min/max values (or not, this is a design issue). Transfer functions are implemented as objects attached to image objects. Their UI is a subclass to Fl_group, displayed through the image's dataWidget.
