#summary Decription of the four managers

Platinum is composed of four "manager" objects that collect and process data based on the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.  This architecture had been selected prior to project onset – the MVC pattern was introduced subsequently to guide development, as well as to impart familiarity to developers who may get involved at a later stage.

==Datamanager==
[datamanager] manages the creation, deletion and retrieval of volume data sets – model.
==Viewmanager==
[viewmanager] manages refresh and selection of viewports in which rendered images of volume data are displayed - controller, where each viewport object that is "managed" comprises a view.
==Rendermanager==
The [rendermanager] connects renderer objects with viewports and image data.
==User IO manager==
[userIOmanager] lists and relays queries/commands between the user and applications implemented in the platform – editor.
