== Header file structure (.h) ==

*private:*

*protected:*

*public:*

-Class constructors/destructors

-Access functions (get_/set_)

-Fuctions of more internal caracter (Reordering/Resampling and draw/handle in case of GUI classes)

== Body file structure (.cc .hxx) ==
For simplicity, implement functions in the same order as in header files.
