#summary Base for point classes
#labels ClassDescription
= Plans =

 The structure is planned as follows
[[data_base*
	[[point_base]]
		[[points ]] multiple points, no structure
			[[point ]] a single point accepts all operations (=a subclass) of points
			[[points_seq ]]
				[[points_seq_closed ]] closed in a loop
				[[points_seq_func ]] parametric = not directly editable
			[[points_mesh ]] interconnected points

==Details==
The location for a [[point]] uses the `origin` field of data_base, which means that it shares basic location operations with data_base and the [[image_base]] subclasses.
