#summary Base for point classes
#labels ClassDescription
= Plans =
The inheritance is planned as follows
 * [data_base]
  * [point_base] base class, maybe redundant
   * [points] multiple points, no structure
    * [point] a single point accepts all operations (=a subclass) of points
    * [points_seq]
     * [points_seq_closed] loop of points
     * [points_seq_func] parametric = not directly editable
    * [points_mesh] interconnected points

==Details==
The location for a [point] uses the `origin` field of data_base, which means that it shares basic location operations with data_base and the [image_base] subclasses. Other point classes either
 # Ignore this field
 # Use it for the first point
 # Use it as a global location, an offset for all member points
