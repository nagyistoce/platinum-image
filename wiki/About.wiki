#summary Project origins and goals

The Platinum project started at the [http://www.radiol.uu.se/ Image- and function center of Uppsala university hospital] and is now being further developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca.

In hospital and corporate clinical imaging environments, image processing algorithm development tends to be a multi-stage cycle, where several steps are required to evaluate each change in the developing software. The steps include coding, compiling, execution – which may comprise multiple steps including specifying arguments – and evaluation by using a separate image viewer. The imaging platform is intended to aid these research projects in reducing the development cycle time and effort, allowing scientists to focus on their research.

== Technology ==
The Platinum library is written in C++, using templates and many components of the Standard Template Library. It is intended to operate in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X environments and is built using CMake.

== Licensing ==
Platinum is published under the GNU Lesser General Public Licens (LGPL), with the intention of allowing proprietary applications to utilize the platform while the platform itself remains free software. Certain components have more permissive licenses (the Histo2D and example programs) or are in the public domain (WIN32 dirent substitute).
