#summary Description of Platinum classes
Classes in _italics_ are planned (some prototyped), but not implemented.
=View & rendering=
*Viewport*
Abstraction of widget containing controls and image pane (implemented in FLTKviewport) for each viewpoint of data.

*FLTKviewport*
FLTK implementation of the central pane of each viewport that displays the rendered image and can be clicked/dragged in.

*[viewmanager]*
Viewmanager lists the available viewports and allows access through viewport ID and various ways of requesting updates.

*Renderer_base*
Renderers produce a 2D viewport pixmap out of images and point sets. The base class has virtual functions for coordinate storage conversion, common to different renderer types.

*Renderer_VTK*
Abstract base for VTK-based renderers.

*RendererMPR*
MPR renderer subclass which also renders thumbnails via a static function. Like other possible renderers it also converts between local and global coordinate systems.

*Rendercombination*
Stores list of volumes and blend mode(s) for renderers.

*Rendergeometry*
Rendergeometry stores rendering coordinates (look at, orientation and zoom) for renderers.

*Rendermanager*
Keeps a list of renderer objects and handles communication between viewport and renderer.

=Data handling=
_*Point_base*_
The untemplated base class for point collections.

*Datamanager*
The datamanager maintains a list of work data loaded or created at runtime. It has functions for loading and saving data (that invoke functions in the relevant classes).

==Image storage==
*Image_base*
Untemplated base class for image storage, including volumes, contains 3D position and orientation information.

*Image_general*
Image class templated over voxel data type.

*Image_scalar*
Image type with scalar voxel/pixel values. Mostly the same as image_general.

*Image_multi*
Base class for images with multispectral data, such as vectors or complex.

_*Image_complex*_
Image class with complex voxels.

*Image_integer*
Image type with integer values, in itself and as base for more task-specific subclasses.

_*Image_label*_
Image type with integer values signifying distinct classes or "labels" (i.e. not continuous values). Can be described as multiple binary volumes rolled into one. 0 (zero) carries special meaning as empty/background.

=User interaction=
*Datawidget* 
The datawidget is the GUI representation of a dataset (image/point). It provides controls for saving, deleting and shows the thumbnail. 

*UserIO* 
Class defining an operation on data presented to the user in a list.
*FLTKuserIOparameter_base*
Base class for numerous parameter widgets populating userIO blocks. Handles value retrieval, updates and creation/deletion.
 
*UserIOmanager*
Maintains a list of userIO blocks, and relays all operations on blocks and their parameters. The interface to this class is independent of the FL toolkit.

=Helper classes=
_*Color*_
Color storage class.

_*Colormap*_ 
Interpolated color map class.

_*Cursor3D*_ 
3D cursor that could be implemented as a point3D.

*Histogram_base* 
Base class for processing of histograms in 1-3D (separated from user interface).

*Histogram_2D* 
Displays and does area higlights of a 2D histogram.

*Thresholdparvalue* 
N-dimensional threshold values with optional shape variations. Includes a function for creating a new volume through thresholding. 

==2D histogram segmentation specials==
*Threshold_overlay*
Overlay to viewports that displays a segmentation preview for the 2D histogram segmentation project.

*FLTK2Dregionofinterest* 
Overlay to viewports that displays region of interest information, including a rectangular selection and threshold_overlay segmentation previews.
