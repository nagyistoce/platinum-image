= Introduction =

The pt_event object (with FLTK-implementing subclass) is the interface that allows events to be handled with the future option of migrating from FLTK.

=Usage=
A viewport_event object is kept in each [FLTKviewport]. It is updated prior to engaging the callback (function viewport_callback), the [viewport] then accesses this object and handles the event.

When a pt_event is handled, the `grab` metod has to be called to mark the event as taken care of.
